## 📚👩🎓 StudyBuddy: A Personalized Tutoring App

By accessing your course documents, StudyBuddy provides context-sensitive guidance and support, boosting your understanding and performance in your courses.

## 💡 Inspiration

Our primary inspiration for StudyBuddy sprouted from the evolving world of User Interface (UI) design. We found a growing trend towards users querying AI for information rather than browsing through traditional UIs. This, coupled with the desire to create a robust platform that could evolve and expand over time, led to the genesis of StudyBuddy. We envisioned a platform that could revolutionize the way students interact with their course materials and assignments, making learning more personal and effective.

## 🛠️ How we built it

StudyBuddy was brought to life using a combination of cutting-edge technologies. The front end was crafted using TypeScript and React, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. For the backend, we utilized a Flask app to make API calls for the Canvas API, OpenAI API, and Documents Loaders/Transformers. The Langchain library was instrumental for the LLM Prompt engineering and chaining, enabling us to create a dynamic and responsive tutoring system. This blend of technologies allowed us to create a platform that is both powerful and adaptable.
